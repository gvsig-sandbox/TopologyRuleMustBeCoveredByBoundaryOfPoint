# TopologyRuleMustBeCoveredByBoundaryOfPoint
This rule is useful when is needed that points be align with the boundaries of polygons.
Points in one layer must be covered by boundaries of polygons in another layer, if are not coincident a report of points error is created, this report is composed by the points from the first layer that are not covered by boundaries of polygons from the second layer.
